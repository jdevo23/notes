### Summary:

The author draws examples from previous technological advances; maps, clocks, radio, machinery, and books such as Marshall McLuhan's The Medium is the Massage to suggest that while we are programming the internet, the internet is also programming our brains. The title _The Shallows_ refers to the shallow thinking that is encouraged by the distracted nature of the internet. The author argues that from the overload of stimuli, memory suffers, attention splinters and thinking becomes superficial.

### Key points:

- There is evidence to suggest that simply remembering where to look on the internet for information, rather than committing it to memory, is causing negative effects to our ability to memorise anything
- Similarly, our reliance on technology to provide us with relevant information, such as machine learning, is said to impact negatively on our ability to make these connections ourselves
- There's evidence to suggest that being in nature is a key component to learning. Walking in a city did not provide the cognitive benefits that walking in nature did, according to one study
- The constant nature of the internet can prevent our brain from being able to use unconscious thought to develop longer term memories and conjure solutions from a deeper level
- Web products tend to be built with the intention of keeping the user online as much as possible. They do this by "hijacking" the psychological factors which encourage us to seek out novelty

### Takeaways:

- When we use a technology, we should consider what we stand to lose as well as what we stand to gain
- Being in nature regularly is important for both mental health and learning
- Take regular breaks
- Step away from the technology as often as possible. Stick to using the technology for its purpose
- We need a defined goal, a lack of distractions (meaning go for a walk, lie down in a quiet room, sleep), and a longer period away from the technology to allow the deeper level of thinking to begin making connections
